Pseudocode:

open random_points.txt for reading
read the contents of random_points.txt into an array of 10,000 Vec3s
close random_points.txt

open random_planes.txt for reading
read the contents of random_planes.txt into an array of 5 Planes
close random_planes.txt

for each plane:
	open planeXA.txt for writing
	open planeXB.txt for writing

	for each point:
		determine if the point is above, on, or below the plane
		if the point is above the plane:
			print the point to planeXA.txt
		else if the point is below the plane:
			print the point to planeXB.txt

	close planeXA.txt
	close planeXB.txt


Design:

class Vec3
class Plane
	public Vec3 normal
	public float offset
	public float CheckPoint( const Vec3& p )
		returns positive for a point above the plane
		returns 0 for a point on the plane
		returns negative for a point below the plane
